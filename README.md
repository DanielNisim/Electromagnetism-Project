# Electromagnetism-Project
This project is about developing simulations for electromagnetic phenomena. The simulations will allow users to observe and manipulate the behavior of virtual objects, allowing them to gain a better understanding of the mechanics of electromagnetism. The project is written in Python and uses the popular SciPy library for scientific computing. It also uses the NumPy library for numerical computing, the Matplotlib library for visualization and the Tkinter library for it's interface. The project aims to provide a powerful, user-friendly, and interactive environment for students and enthusiasts to explore the field of electromagnetism.


This project includes simulations for:
1.Electric fields of objects
2.Magnetic fields of objects
3.Cartesian potential problems
4.Cylindrical potential problems
5.Polarization demonstrations, including half and quarter wave plates
6.A moving charge

In order to run the simulations open the Main.py file and run it. The interface will appear on screen and from there choose the simulation you want to run.
