# Electromagnetism-Project
This project is about developing simulations for electromagnetic phenomena. The simulations will allow users to observe and manipulate the behavior of virtual objects, allowing them to gain a better understanding of the mechanics of electromagnetism. The tool will be written in Python and use the popular SciPy library for scientific computing. It will also use the NumPy library for numerical computing, and the Matplotlib library for visualization. The project aims to provide a powerful, user-friendly, and interactive environment for students and enthusiasts to explore the field of electromagnetism.


This project includes simulations for:
1.Electric fields of objects
2.Magnetic fields of objects
3.Cartesian potential problems
4.Cylindrical potential problems
5.Polarization demonstrations, including half and quarter wave plates
6.A moving charge
